# pygraph
A graph manipulation library in pure Python

Pygraph aims to be an easy-to-use and functional graph library that doesn't sacrifice advanced capabilities or usability in the process.

By implementing the library in pure Python, it can be installed without any dependencies aside from the Python core, enabling maximum ease of use.

Common algorithms supported will include:
* DFS
* BFS
* Connected Components
* Biconnected Components
* Articulation Vertices
* Minimum Spanning Tree

Advanced algorithms supported will include:
* Triconnected Components
* Separation Pairs
* Planarity Testing
* Fully Dynamic Planarity Testing
* Planar Embedding
